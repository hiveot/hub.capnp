# WoST Hub

The WoST Hub is the reference implementation of the Hub for the Web of (Secured) Things. It receives information from 'Things' and provides a Thing shadow device to consumers. Consumers interact with Things through the Hub provided shadow devices without connecting directly to the Thing. The Hub aims to be compatible with the WoT open standard but is constrainted to features that meet the WoST security mandate of "Things Do Not Run Servers".

## Project Status

Status: Alpha

A second iteration of the Hub is in progress. The Hub message bus is reworked to provide the Thing API itself and can be run as a WebSocket or MQTT service. Plugins use this API to receive information from and control Things.



## Audience

This project is aimed at software developers and system implementors with knowledge of operating systems and computing devices. 

A Binary distribution of the Hub and its plugins can be installed and used by users with basic Linux skills.

## Summary

The WoST Hub provides a shadow representation of discovered Things. Things register themselves with the Hub while consumers discover and control things through the Hub. The Hub acts as an intermediary and avoid the need to provide direct access to Things by consumers. This keeps the Thing isolated and secure.

The WoST Hub is intended to be used with WoST compliant IoT devices (WoST Things)and legacy devices. WoST compliant devices automatically discover the Hub on a local network and provision themselves with the Hub. After provisioning the device sends its Thing Description and its events to the Hub, from where it can be accessed and monitored. 

Legacy devices that are not WoST compliant are accessed through plugins that convert between the legacy format and WoT standards. They can be used as if they are WoT devices via the Hub APIs.

In either case WoST Things are never accessed directly. WoST managed IoT devices should remain in a secured fire-walled area. End users view and control the devices through the Hub. For use within the Local Area Network this works entirely stand-alone and no Internet access is required. For remote access and monitoring, the Hub can connect securely to a cloud based Hub. Here too, there is never a direct connection from the Internet to the local network.

The features of the Hub is provided through plugins. Core plugins provide support for Thing provisioning and discovery. 

## WoST vs WoT

As mentioned elsewhere in more detail, WoST is an implementation of WoT with the restriction that **Things do not run a server**. Instead WoST 'Things' push their data into the WoST hub that provides intermediary services to access the Thing. The reason behind this approach is that of security. Implementing servers securely is hard and not a role for a simple IoT device.

WoST therefore supports [section 6.7 of the WoT architecture](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#direct-communication) with a protocol binding that requires the Thing to connect to an Intermediary. The WoST Hub is in this case the intermediary and implements a server for the Thing to connect to using one of its protocol bindings. 

## Installation

The WoST Hub is designed to run on Linux based computers. Mac, Windows and Android versions are currently not considered since the recommendation is to run it on a stand-alone computer. 

### System Requirements

Unless the Hub is provided as part of an appliance, it needs to be installed on a computer. It is best to use a dedicated computer for this. 

For home users a raspberry pi 2+ will be powerful enough to run the Hub and simple plugins. For industrial or automotive usage a dedicated embedded computer system is recommended.

In its most basic configuration the Hub needs less than 100MB of RAM and an ARMv7 CPU as found on a PI2. See plugin documentation for additional memory requirements.

### Install From Package Manager

Installation from package managers is currently not available.

### Manual Install As User

The Hub can be installed and run as a dedicated user. 

Installation tarballs will be made available or build from source.
After untarring or building go to the 'dist' folder and copy the files to the home's bin folder.
```
mkdir ~/bin/wost
cp -a * ~/bin/wost
```
This will create the following folder structure

* /home/{user}/bin/wost/bin      hub and plugin binaries
* /home/{user}/bin/wost/config   hub and plugin configuration
* /home/{user}/bin/wost/logs     hub and plugin logging output
* /home/{user}/bin/wost/certs    TLS certificates generated by the 
  

### Manual Install To System

For systemd installation, as root for user 'wost'. 
When changing the user and folders make sure to edit the wost-hub.service file accordingly.
From the dist folder run:
```
# Create folders
mkdir /opt/wost/       
mkdir /etc/wost/       
mkdir /etc/wost/certs/ 
mkdir /var/log/wost/   

# Install WoST configuration and systemd
# unpack the tarball in a temp for and run:
sudo cp config/* /etc/wost
sudo cp init/wost-hub.service /etc/systemd/system
sudo cp dist/bin/* /opt/wost

# Setup user and permissions
adduser --system --no-create-home --home /opt/wost --shell /usr/sbin/nologin --group wost
chown -R wost:wost /etc/wost
chown -R wost:wost /var/log/wost

systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Build From Source

To build the core and bundled plugins from source, a Linux system with golang and make tools must be available. 3rd party plugins are out of scope for these instructions and can require nodejs, python and golang.

Prerequisites:
1. Golang 1.14 or newer
2. GCC Make

Build and install from source (tentative):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/wostzone/hub
$ make all 
```

After the build is complete, the distribution binaries can be found in the 'dist/bin' folder for 64 bit Intel CPUs and dist/arm for ARM CPUs. 

## Configuration

The Hub is configured through the 'hub.yaml' configuration file that can be edited with a regular text editor. The sample file in the dist config folder contains configuration options with the default values.

The Hub looks in the ./config folder or the /etc/wost folder for this file. This file is optional. Out of the box defaults will provide a working hub with an internal service bus that listens on localhost port 9678 (WOST). 

Plugins can optionally be configured through yaml configuration files in the same configuration folder.

## Launching

The Hub can be launched manually by invoking the 'hub' app in the wost folder.
eg ~/bin/wost/bin/hub

A systemd launcher can be configured to launch automatically on startup for Linux systems that use systemd. 

```
systemctl enable wost-hub
systemctl start wost-hub
```

## Plugin Installation

Plugins are installed in the Hub 'bin' directory. By default this is the location of the Hub binary. A separate plugin directory can be configured in the hub.yaml configuration file if desired.

After downloading or building the plugin executable:
1. Copy the plugin executable from dist/bin or dist/arm into the Hub binary folder.
2. Copy the plugin configuration file dist/config/{plugin}.yaml to the Hub configuration folder.  
3. Enable the plugin in hub.yaml configuration file in the 'plugins' section.It will be started automatically when the Hub starts.


# Design 

![Design Overview](./docs/hub%20design.png)

## Overview

The WoST Hub consists of an internal message bus and a curated set of plugins. The plugins fall into two categories, protocol bindings and services. Protocol bindings connect with Things and 3rd party IoT devices while services provide consumer side functionality such as directory services. When available the WoT specified data and API definitions are used.

All services of the WoST Hub are provided through these plugins. Plugins can be written in any language, including ECMAScript to be compliant with the [WoT Scripting API](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#sec-scripting-api). It is even possible to write a plugin for plugins to support a particular programming platform such as EC6. 

As mentioned, plugins fall into two categories depending on their primary purpose:
* Protocol bindings provide connectivity for WoST Things and for legacy/3rd party IoT devices. These plugins convert the device description data they receive to a Thing Description document and submit these onto the Hub Message bus. Actions received from the message bus are passed back to the Thing after converting it into the Thing's native format. 
  
* Service plugins provide a service to consumer applications. They can receive requests and publish actions for Things to execute. Services can make additional API's available to consumers, for example a directory service can have a HTTP and a websocket API. All communication from consumers to Things goes via services. Services listen on the Message bus for thing descriptions and events and can publish actions to be performed by Things.

## Hub Message Bus

The Hub Message Bus API is WoT compatible and its messages conform to the format defined in the WoT TD standard. 

The Hub supports two message bus implementations: A built-in simple message bus (smbus) and MQTT. 

The built-in message bus is intended for running the Hub out of the box without requiring much setup. This configuration generates client and server certificates for use by the plugin and uses TLS to communicate with the bus. The certificates are generated on first start and are only accessible to the user that runs the Hub and its plugins.

Support for MQTT over TLS is built-in. The hub must be configured with the address of the MQTT broker and its server certificate. 

Publishers and subscribers to the message MUST follow the WoT Thing API. Since at the time of writing a MQTT protocol binding API is not specified, a best guess is made based on the Mozilla REST API. See the API section for details.

The included message bus client library (for use by plugins) support both the internal message bus and MQTT and uses the hub.yaml configuration file to determine where to connect. The plugin does not need to know which message bus is used. The Hub client library will be made available for programming language such as golang, ES6, and Python. 

## Protocol Binding Plugins


## Service Plugins

Service plugins provide their own API to the consumer. For example a directory service provides the Directory API to query for Things. The admin plugin provides a web page to administer the Hub and its plugins. 

Service plugins subscribe to TD and Event messages to obtain information about things and can publish actions to control Things.

Service plugins can also create a new channel to communicate with other plugins, specific to the purpose of the plugin. A schema definition for the new channel must be defined and followed.

<todo>See the list of available service plugins for details. </todo>

Service plugins included with the hub provide a works-out-of-the-box experience. The use of these plugins is optional: 

* The 'directory' service provides an HTTPS API for consumers to query discovered Things. 

* The 'forwarder' service forwards select Exposed Things to another cloud based intermediary such as another WoST hub. Intended to safely access Things via the cloud. 

* The 'recorder' service is a simple example plugin that records channel messages into files. Intended for testing.

* The 'intermediary' service makes Things available to an intermediary, such as another Hub in the cloud using the Thing APIs of the intermediary. An authorization model determines which Things and which actions are shared with the intermediary. This is intended to provide access to Things for authorized users from over the internet without the need to open up the firewall.

* The 'scripting' service provides an ECMA scripting engine to let the user run scripts. Scripts can access the message bus through the messaging client library.

* The 'admin' plugin provides an web based administration panel to view and configure Things and plugins.

## Writing Plugins

Plugins can be written in any programming language by using the network interfaces. The Hub provides a messenger client library in Golang to easily connect to the message bus. This library will be maintained along with the hub. Implementations in Python and Javascript are planned for the future.

Plugins run in their own process, isolated from other plugins. 

A [scripting API](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-scripting-api/) is also planned and  can also be used to create plugins.

See [the documentation on writing plugins](docs/writing-plugins.md). 


## Launching Plugins

Plugins are launched at startup and given the same arguments as the Hub to determine the configuration and message bus connection information:

```
-c            /path/to/hub.yaml optional alt configuration, default is {home}/config/hub.yaml
-home         /path/to/app/home    optional alternative application home folder/ Defa
-certsFolder  /path/to/alt/certs   optional certificate folder, eg when using mqtt. Default is {home}/certs
-configFolder /path/to/alt/config  optional alternative config, eg /etc/wost
-hostname     localhost:9678       optional alternative message bus, eg mosquitto:8883
-logFile      /path/to/hub.log optional logfile. Use to determine logs folder
-protocol mqtt | smbus             default is smbus
-pluginFolder                      optional alt plugin folder, default is {home}/bin
-logLevel warning                  for extra logging, default is hub loglevel
-useTLS true                       option to not use TLS, default true
```

The plugin configuration file is pluginID.yaml in the {home}/config folder. This file is optional. A default file is provided with the plugin. This file describes the plugin properties, events and actions in TD compatible format.
